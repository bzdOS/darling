# cft-dlopen: localize the Chrome-framework dlopen failure on the live June dyld

The chrome probe on the live June dyld (`b8df2a76`) loads 41 images, then
fails at `dlopen //../Frameworks/Google Chrome for Testing
Framework.framework/Versions/154.0.8029.0/Google Chrome for Testing
Framework: … image not found`. Where does it break?

## Step 0 — the guest cannot read a `<8`-entry directory (confirmed)

A guest `ls` (the overlay's `/bin/ls` run under mldr) on directories with
known real entry counts:

```
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks  (1 real entry)  -> 0 entries printed
/System/Library/Frameworks         (60 real entries) -> 38 entries printed
```

So a directory with fewer than 8 entries yields nothing to the guest, and
a larger one is truncated — the `getdirentries64` wall. The app's
`Contents/Frameworks/` has 1 real entry (the framework), so the guest
cannot see it.

## Step 1 — where `//../Frameworks/…` comes from

`launch-dynamic-smoke.c`'s Chrome staging (lines ~730-832) says the
framework is staged into `$LOCAL/Frameworks` "so the guest sees it at
`/Frameworks/Google Chrome for Testing Framework.framework/…`", and that a
`/tmp/Frameworks` symlink is created (`symlink("../Frameworks",
"/tmp/Frameworks")`) "so Chrome's `@loader_path/../` resolution works".
Chrome's loader path resolves to the guest's root, so `@loader_path/../`
clamps at `/` and yields `//../Frameworks/…` = `/Frameworks/…`.

## Step 2/3 — the stage-level padding does not fix it

The guest's `/Frameworks/` was padded to **9 entries** (the framework plus
8 `.pad*` files, in the local overlay — the live overlay untouched), and
the chrome probe re-run (staging cached). The failure is **identical**:

```
dlopen //../Frameworks/…/Google Chrome for Testing Framework: … image not found.
```

So the dlopen failure is **not** the simple `<8`-entry count of
`/Frameworks/`: the resolve still fails deeper (the framework's
`Versions/…` path, or the `//../` resolution itself).

## Verdict (one line)

The `getdirentries64` `<8`-entry wall is confirmed for listing (1→0,
60→38) and `//../Frameworks/…` is `@loader_path/../` from the guest's
root; a stage-level padding of the guest's `/Frameworks/` to 9 entries
does **not** fix the dlopen (still `image not found`), so the failure is
deeper than the entry count — the framework's `Versions/…`/path resolve
on the June dyld.
